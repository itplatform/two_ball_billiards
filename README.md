Programming Exercise
===================

Congratulations, you have passed the first phase of our interview. 

On this second phase we are going to test your programming skills, so we have a exercise template writen in Java that you will need to complete. (you could easily change to a language of your preference)

Follow the instructions of the exam below, and produce the given results in any language of your preference. 

The solution should be complete and production ready. Please do not write just the core code algorithm, leaving out e.g. error handling.
Your code should be covered by unit tests.
Feel free to use any kind of unit test framework

Description

Write a program to predict a final position of two balls that are moving on a billiards kind of table. 

1.Assume that the balls are of 0 radius; i.e. they are infinitesimally small. 

2.The balls may collide with each other or the billiards table wall.

3.Assume that the collisions are perfectly elastic

4.Assume that there is no friction anywhere

5.Assume that the acceleration is 0. 

Input/Output

Input: 

1.The size of the table is given – 1 x 1 mts; i.e. a square table. That is a program constant

2.The initial location of the two balls would be given to you in terms of [x,y] coordinates; the lower left corner of the table is [0,0]

3.The initial velocity of the two balls is given – The speed, in mts/sec, AND the direction at which the balls are moving specified as angle from the positive y axis in clockwise direction. Remember we are viewing the table as a Cartesian plane with lower left corner at [0,0] E.g. if the ball is moving in positive y direction (north), the angle is 0, if the ball is moving east the angle is 90. 

4.nTimeInSec – Time in seconds after which the position is to be calculated. So your program has to simulate the balls moving on that table for that many seconds, handling any collisions that might occur in between.  

Output: 

1.The position of the balls, in the [x,y] plane after nTimeInSec. 

Good luck!
